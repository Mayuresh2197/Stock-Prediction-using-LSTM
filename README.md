Please refer to the Notebook and the HTML version to find the code and implementation. 

All the steps have been mentioned in the Notebook within the comments, making it easier to understand the code as you go. 

The Stock Data is pulled in using Yahoo Finance and interactive visualizations are made using Plotly. 

The LSTM algorithm is implemented using a Neural Network. 

Feedback is highly appreciated!
